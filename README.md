# UNSLAM 25
This is the GitHub organization for UNSLAM project, a 2024-2025 two years project from UNLAM - Universidad de La Matanza.

In a recent project we implemented an hybrid vSLAM system running on cell phones: the phone describe the camera captured image and send its description to a server for further processing, allowing to run vSLAM system in real time on mobile devices.

UNSLAM 25 aim to usability and availability.  The hybrid vSLAM system is hard to compile and have it running.  We are implementing installers for it, and at the same time updating it with up to date libraries.

Right now there are three forked repos and no build instruction.  We will provide some build instructions after the updated version is running.
